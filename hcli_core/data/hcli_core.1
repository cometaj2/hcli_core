.SH NAME
hcli_core \- An HCLI Connector that can be used to expose a REST API with a built-in CLI, via hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.
.SH SYNOPSIS

[

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hcli_core
is a Web Service Gateway Interface (WSGI; PEP 3333) application that provides a way for developers to expose a REST API as a CLI via HCLI v1.0 semantics.
This enables immediate, dynamic and up to date in-band access to man page style API/CLI documentation.
.PP
HCLI Core deploys with support for two distinct HCLI:
.PP
- The user defined Core HCLI application provided as a plugin path.
.br
- The Management HCLI application used to manage local credentials (hco, which can be interacted with using an HCLI client).
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
HCLI Core relies on the use of a configuration file. If none is provided as a file path, the default configuration included with hcli_core
is used.
.PP
The configuration file is expected to be formatted in the configparser format which defines sections and assigned name = value pairs. See
the EXAMPLE section for details on how to submit a custom configuration file path to hcli_core at launch.
.PP
The configuration supports enabling or disable authentication for:
.PP
- The Core HCLI application provided as a plugin path.
.br
- The Management HCLI application used to manage local credentials (hco).
.PP

.SS CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
[config]
.br
core.auth = False
.br
mgmt.auth = True
.br
.SH AUTHENTICATION
If authentication is configured for an HCLI application, HCLI Core expects to be able to use a config and credentials file, called "credentials".
The default included credentials file provided with HCLI Core SHOULD NOT be used but is included as an example file format.
.PP
The HCLI application (hco) is made available on the management port 9000 to help manage user credentials and api keys.
.PP
The default expected administrator user is an admin user set with '*' defaults for both the hashed password and its salt. On first startup, HCLI Core generates a random password and assigns it to the admin user. The password is immediately set and is displayed only once in the log output. It SHOULD be changed immediately to maintain security.
.PP
HCLI Core can function without any credentials listed in the credentials file.
.PP
When the HCLI Management application's authentication is disabled, no changes are allowed via hco (the HCLI Management application)
.PP
.SS HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION
By default, usernames and passwords stored in the credentials file are expected to be used with HTTP Basic Authentication. Note that usernames and passwords can't contain a ":".
.PP
The credentials file MAY contain as many additional users as is desired; one user per uniquely named section.
.PP
HTTP Basic Authenthentication SHOULD NOT be used without HTTPS and SHOULD NOT generally be considered secure. This is provided as a bare convenience if authentication capabilities are found useful.
.I However, authentication using HTTP Basic Authentication is slower by design to help improve security. Its use SHOULD remain limited, and other authentication schemes should be preferred.
.PP
.SS HCOAK (HCLI CORE API KEY) AUTHENTICATION
API keyids and API keys stored in the credentials file are expected to be used with the HCLI Core bundled "hco" HCLI application generated API keys. Those API keys SHOULD make use of the HTTP Bearer authentication scheme.
.PP
The expected HCOAK Bearer format is a base64 encoded and colon separated "keyid:hcoak" ("Bearer base64(keyid:hcoak)"). For example:
.PP
keyid = GJSLKO5Z5M
.br
hcoak = hcoak_FMn4dirl8kVoV1z96II84AeEDIbYyxTXZkMLllfgx8Deqwz0D1Rq88ObQBleUpN_Qncek8otlPx4ZaIYWtFWcQ"
.PP
The credentials file MAY contain as many additional keyids and apikeys as is desired; one such keyid and apikey per uniquely named section.
.PP
HCOAK SHOULD NOT be used without HTTPS and is primary intended to be used with 3rd party HCLI applications hosted alongside hco.
.PP
.SS CREDENTIALS FILE FORMAT
[default]
.br
username = admin
.br
password = *
.br
salt = *
.PP
[<someothersection>]
.br
username = <someotheruser>
.br
password = <hashed password>
.br
salt = <salt>
